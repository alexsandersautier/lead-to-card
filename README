# Event Goals

## 📋 About the Project

Event management system developed with Django, focused on demonstrating asynchronous processing implementation with Celery for performance optimization and better user experience.

## 🎯 Features

The system has three main routes:

### 1. **Home** (`/`)
- Captures participant's name and email interested in the event

### 2. **Register** (`/register`)
- Validates the provided data (name and email)
- Stores information in the database
- Triggers email sending with event invitation

### 3. **Confirmation** (`/confirmation`)
- Displays a friendly message confirming event registration

## 🚀 Technical Motivation

This project was developed to demonstrate in practice the benefits of asynchronous processing with **Celery**.

### Without Celery
The user would need to wait for the entire email sending operation to complete before viewing the confirmation page, resulting in unnecessary waiting time.

### With Celery
The email sending task is delegated to Celery, allowing the user to view the confirmation page instantly while the email is processed in the background.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python/Django** - Web framework
- **Celery** - Asynchronous task processing
- **Redis** - Message broker for Celery
- **Docker** - Redis containerization

## 📦 Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/event-goals.git
cd event-goals
```

### 2. Create and activate virtual environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run database migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create a superuser to access the admin panel
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 6. Start Redis with Docker
```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis
```

## ▶️ Running the Project

To run the project, you will need **two terminals** open simultaneously:

### Terminal 1 - Celery Worker
```bash
celery -A core worker --loglevel=INFO
```

### Terminal 2 - Django Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Access the application at: `http://localhost:8000`

## 🔑 Admin Panel Access

After creating the superuser, access: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
